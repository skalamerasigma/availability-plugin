You are looking at my DM just specifically, that you know that she b me or she bed you to, I saw I was like, you know, I look at you.. sometimes not because we did something wrong, but because there are room of who on the boxes like. Where we have to admit, we're not great at, like, the facting how severe stuff is for the business, escalating, and all of that. So that's why I sometimes can't. But I'll come back after I need to say there say anything we should have done. I is when you say I got this US. OK, how I didn't have a chat, you might have done this, but it usually felt like, as it had this way you didn't run and they long before the outage or not? it was lab or not. I don't know. I hadn't read that conversation yesterday. I? Yeah, yeah. So the plane leaves in three hours. You're right. No, I don't know. I'll be about next time. Will you that you they go care you? I hear,. Hey Stephen, I need one minute. Yeah, sure. No... How are you doing? Pretty good. Your yourself. I have this escalation from Morgan Stanley. Sonic is working on. Yep.. I'm kind of. I'll be honest. I'm kind of bummed that I had to get a I had to get a pain from Jewity of like, we're not closing the lundes. And I feel like I saw this more. Again, I don't blame so well, I don't know the deep. Now I also say that I'm not focused here, but I don't know if we didn't close the loop, or, like, if the customer became unresponsive, but it feels like the kind of like the CSM needs to chase the support in order to get responsivity. Hmm.. So that's where it's not great. Yeah, that shouldn't be the case. Um. Let's see. I'll share with you this, the ta. And I'm trying to understand. what break, what broke down in the communication channel.. Wait, who was was it Julia that was talking to him? It's both of them. Well., but the actual, like, intercom chat, because Julia says, here, my chat chat with them is closed because they stopped responding. I feel like that's where they... were wondering what happened.. Yes. Yeah. I'd have to look into this a little bit deeper, to.. What? Sorry, what was that? I didn't hear what you said. Sorry. I was just saying, there's there's a lot here I would need to read through to see exactly what's going on. Looks like Zen is about to comment. I see him typing. Yeah, well, I see it. What is, not to me is like, where is the breakdown in communication? Yeah. I.e.. kind of like driving things to completion, kind of like, that was, like, it's difficult to see who owns it once, it's kind of like tackled engine. Like, it's kind of like we ask a question to engineering, that's never being addressed, basically, no one owns, like, going back to them. And again, I might be wrong here and I need to read the inter intercom. Yeah, I'd have to read the intercom. But they kind of like see this like notion I'm not sure is good, but I'm sure it's not good about us escalating something, it depends on someone else, but we never close the door like getting back to the caster. And so the customer will ask us, "Hey, what's up?" And then someone will work on them. But if they don't ask, "Hey, what's up, then it's and I might there might be other communications that we don't see, but here I we let that basically hang for 24 hours. went back to Morgan Stanley, and since like the issue processess. So it would be good to figure out, how we not do that? Yeah. Big customerers or any customers, to be honest, but especially with big ones. Yeah, I would like to look through that chat itself and see where it. I So, fun for Nick, he was both in blue yonder and this one.. It would be good to see Kamard from both, work at a gun better, and still can go better. Mm hmm. Because even now they are going back and forth, I don't know if anyone actually speak with the customer to say, like, you kind of like, go and say, "What's happening?" It's not about the customer, but none of them were picking up the Zoom to sit with them. So. I'm just reading what this end posted. What are people love doing the zooms, but I think they spend it on the wrong people. Yeah, I.. I guess he's saying that chat was closed. I don't I don't. Mm hmm. Let's, I see it like we have on it and see. I see that Nick is still there. Yeah, high. They're working on it. I saw them working on it. Oh, think it's like a person, he's an SM. Like, he wasn't like big escalation of like, and just in general, I was like, We saw this show in a closed time frame twice. And again, it's not New York and Steph, but, like, in this case, it's happened in New York twice. Look into it, at the chair, and like, seeing, I don't know. Yeah. what, let's speak about it, because I I think both of them in good cases where, like, someone in asking us to like, close and open something we own and we. at least need to have a better, better story. I agree. I. How's your week going? Uh, good. Uh slowing down a bit, so I' started to shift my focus to that, uh the tip that we were discussing. And I should have uh, well, I will have something for you by the end of the week. How do you feel with the slow down meaning like all all the work you did with graceful the Q4 are we good to go? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was referring to. Just getting that metric in for Q4 and getting a proposal together very general one, but something together to discuss with the rest of the managers next week on how we want to go about improving it for the, you know, permanently, for the next quarter and future one. So yeah, that and just everything else that I've been working on as far as the the workflows and things like that seems like every day there's something I need to adjust or modify or fix. Not that it takes a that much time, but that seems to be slowing down too. So. Yeah. He's not. Do you feel like it's it's expected? Because, like, you, like, you create something and you eat a little you go? Yeah. So it's something that you didn't expect. No, it was expected. I mean, there's a few things that I just didn't think of when I was creating the workloadows. Like weekend I didn't even cross my mind that we shouldn't, probably shouldn't send an automated message on a Saturday afternoon. right? So just little things like that, you know, it takes five minutes to go in there and and uh change it. But uh no, it's good that it's surfacing now and it's good that I'm getting the feedback people are reaching out and and let me know when they see things are off. And I try to fix it right away. But like I said, that it was happening a lot more after I after I first rolled it out. it's becoming more stable now. And just need to get people to. Most people are, they're using it. A lot of them are using it as they should. Some people are still defaulting to just doing manually manual snoozes sometimes, but I think that's going to be the case.. Unfortunately, it's going to take time for people to fully transition over to using it. But. They are getting used a good amount and I was looking the other day and I think we have like a couple hundred, like auto closures already. So, I don't know how much time, that's saving them, but, you know, that's a couple hundred chats that they' never had the follow up on. So, you know, that'll, over time, that adds up. Okay. Bye. So, yeah, now, I'm just going to. If you in terms of like people kind of like adopting it, where you see how things are going, like how do you haven' gooden and I can good grasp on, like, who's kind of like, which office needs more knowledge to get people to do it? Because it's still, I don't think it's mangatory, right? It's like you need to change your practice. Yeah. I don't, it isn't mandatory. And I think a lot of that is because I've been doing so many modifications to, you know, get it stable. I think the managers where hesitant in enforcing it while, you know, there's so much change happening. So now that that should be in the past, we can start to, you know, and decide what we want to enforce, like, I have data now on, you know, snapshots every, every day for the past few weeks of how many, you know, snooze, chests everyone has and how many open chats they have at the end of each shift. So, you know, we can look and see where a good starting point would be to, you know, set the thresholds. And, you know, try to hold people accountable to it. Otherwise, there's not really any reason we're doing this. But.. Yeah, I think it's just, we need to start, you know, in our one on ones, bring it up, look it over, review it with them. Uh-huh.. I have it up down here on the the monitor. I'm sorry. I bring it up with my reports in our one-on-one. I think it's just, yeah. I think that's all there is to it. But the work, the workbook I have to track all this stuff is in the process of I'm changing the way that I determine if someone's on track or or over the limits.. Basically, it's just going to be kind of the same way we do efficiency. We're just going to track their average number of chats in each category and set a threshold. So right now it's five and five, five open five snoozezed. and, you know, whatever their average is, because we have Snapchats again every every night after their shift. We can get an average of you know, their chat count. And hopefully, you know, the goal is to be under five. And oddly, they are, for the most part, I thought it would be a lot higher than it is, but.. They have been. I don't know if that's. since the workflows have been in place because I' never really looked at, you know, nightly or daily trends like that, but most of them are under, well, the average is, there's some that are a lot higher, but there's some and a lot that finish the day with, you know, zero in the queue. So. And I think it's there's. Just stop heealing you. No, I mean? Yeah, and it's just like, just changing the way that that people have worked for forever is going to be hard for some of them. Like, because there's some that are consistently in the day with 10, you know, open chats and there's some that consistently end up with zero. But then throughout the day, they kind of have the same number of chats. So I think it's just shifting. just the way that they you know, think and think about cleaning their cube before they end their ship that it takes, you know, you can set aside 10 minutes before you leave. Snooze the chats because I don' don't get how there can be open chats at all overnight, right? Because if it's open, then aren't you in the middle of talking to someone? And if you're not in the middle of talking to someone, then it should either be closed or snoozeed. So. You know. It would be because it's new, because we are asking people to do something and we are expecting them to and we're expecting them to change behavior. Yeah. I... You probably have the better grasp of like how people are doing.. The one, like, and maybe it's my, it's a me problem. Like, I feel a little bit, like, zero control on it and then like, it's okay. I' figure it out. because like, at least in terms of like, export or like a workbook or something, it would be really great if we like, add an email or on Slack in the support, at least now, like if we want to hold people accountable, we want managers to be also both accountable, to be honest too. Man people. So send something that we can at least let him in daily view. Yeah. Again, it's not urgent. Like I need a numbers or DC before I need this, but I feel like I want to, like, we launched something, we tried to ask people to do something. I don't know if they do, but that will at least like I'll be able to see it on a daily and at least I have a good better breath on how we're doing. Yeah, that makes sense. I could do like a daily export into Slackack channel for all of us or something. Sure. I think that would be good. Yeah. And it's very simple. It would just be literally just a snapshot of their Q count chats and their cue broken out by snoozed open and the different types of snooze that we use now. Yeah, I'll do that. Yeah.. I think, like, for me specifically, what I care mostly, like, it's on the kind of at the team level of like, how are we doing compar to what the target is. So if like, if Juliet has seven, if D expert gives me, Julia has seven snooze, I don't know if I'll understand like how much I need to push the team to get this or managers to get the people to a better place. So I can about the Metrics, like in terms of like, versus Target. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I can show that, you know. And he show for people that want to manage specific people and grade, you can have that, but. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, I can do that. I can show like the team average and then the outliers. Like, people we should focus on. Okay. Yeah. Go on.. What else? How are people doing? We're closing the que. Good. Just did the just sat through the embed. How it? Learning paths, presentations. It was good. Rashi's was really good. Z was pretty good too. She was just a little nervous doing her presentation, but she did she did. All right. But Rashi app was pretty cool that she made. So I didn't get to sit in on the AI one. I would have liked to, but. Is there another one this week? It's not AI, but. I think called AI you have on Monday, I think.. Monday. on Tuesday, you have the last one, which is, well, I think I live. I think the authentication and the performance one. Yeah, performance.. That one should be interesting. the thing that the deliverable that Ryan working on for most of the time.. Tell me a bit about. Like you said, like he's not gonna pursue. Yeah, so I guess I guess he brought up the idea to Nathan. And I guess they both decided that what he was planning on doing wouldn't be useful. Uh, essentially.. When was that? This was like last week, Ryan messaged me and he was like, I'm not doing the decision tree is what he was going to build, like a. It was going to be a workbook where the thees could go and a decision tree like troubleshooting. How is that not useful? I didn't get much info on why, but he is pivoting to another deliverable where he's going to uh I think he's just going to make a community post. I'm not sure, but it's like something completely different than what he was focusing on. So I'm curious how he's going to do. Yeah. So. But I'm going to follow up I'm going to speak with him and make sure he's okay. to do something. I can't talk like this. Whoa. Some work on, like, something that would be helpful for TSCU. I I a decision tree, and then people to do community posts. Yeah, I think that's what he said. And which is fine if he if he does a good one... True, I think that if it's fine, it's a good one and it serve people, something that is not covered already in the community posts, sure. But it's also like, in terms of like, it's really lower in the bar. And again, I like, I I think as long as like we understand why fine.. So I was just reading. I don't have better than if it's like management, that's one thing. Like I think it would be good to, like know a little bit more about like, why this, like Nathan was discussing this so, like at least this decisionary idea, like being there for, like, a couple of months now. Yeah. So I think it would make sense to understand it. Yeah, I was just reading through my message with him again just to refresh my mind here. So he says that he synced with Nathan. This was last Friday. I was preparing a decision tree. However, we agreed that the number of decisions or number of questions, a TSE has to go through, both in terms of asking the customer and troubleshooting is extremely large, so the decision tree wouldn't be anything that could fit on a white paper and be usable or feasible for TSEs to actually use. So we agreed it wouldn really add value. And Nathan proposed that I shift gears and focus on that's right. Shift gears and focus on a prompt engineering path on how best to use gle to troubleshoot the performance S. So that's what he's focusing on putting together like a document on best ways to prompt Glean to troubleshoot these tasks. Okay. Yeah. I think it's good what I get feedback from Nathan here. Like, is this it the right decision? Oh, like, a decision? Because, like, it's a time. Yeah. Like, I you'll be, you'll be measured based on, like, something that is shit. And, like, I don't see a ship it because you just now is starting to work with it. Yeah. And I don't know if that's the case, but I, I think for you and I, for how do you. Yeah, I go from it. Yeah.s probably good to, like, ask Nathan to. Yeah, I'll follow up with him and. Okay. Get the background here, but, but he does have something to work on that he's focusing on right now, that is hope he has enough time to put something worthwhile together. So. I will that a lot of these learning tests, again, they need to know like, you, like, some of it is definitely, we will put you in style, like, in front of a customer. Like, you need to, like, make sure you know what you're talking about. So the onlyifact is, like, 20%, oh, 30% of like what you've got. Yeah. So I look at all look like like he invented he knows what he's talking about. Yeah. Mostly because we had some people that took this performance for Latin learning class and we didn't feel that like they actually do. Got it. And they are not taking performance learning class office hours, selling. So I think that's one piece. Rashi and Dia, both on your team great. And so you said that like rushing did well, Dogue, are you confident in both of them? Speaking with customers and consolve, it's like, it's not giving support. It's consulting on a band. Yeah, I think I would be comfortable with Rashi doing it tomorrow. I think she's very knowledgeable and she is just, um. She's just good with customers, communicating with customers.. And does it add up very high volume with chats. But Za, I think she has the knowledge. I think she I don't know if I'd be comfortable putting her in front of a customer like immediately, I think., you know, she may need to sit in on a few more of those types of things before she she's even comfortable doing it herself. I know that for a fact. So, yeah, I would say comfortable forachi right now. Za needs more time.. And not, like, too much, not like, another quarter or anything, but I think she needs to she needs to be confident in herself. you know, when she goes on those calls. You know, I know she knows the stuff. And it was, you know evident today. You could just tell that she was kind of nervous, given her presentation. You don't really want to come off that way. in front of a customer, right? So I think it's just a confidence thing and just seeing more people, you know, shadowing more people, a few more times before, you know, we let her do it solo, would be very good. Yeah. Okay. That would be right. No, we'. No, like I. I think it smell. But if you feel that someone is like, not very confident in putting them in front of a customer, will even be more. more like, the stage is even like the stakes that the stage is even like, bigger and higher. Yeah. Because he knows you, she doesn't know the customer. And now she's there, like most notable person in that there in the room. So it is. Yeah. she can continue with's shadow, with bell shadowing with another person in the room for a bit more. I would think that I would say that's definitely what's needed. as opposed to letting her go on or on right now, for sure. But I don't think it's anything that she can't overcome. Like Again, I think it's just. It's just like a confidence thing that she needs to you know, understand that she's the expert and and I think that just comes with time, especially with with her. She was even nervous about going on call, you know, when I first put her on the shift. Yeah. And how is she doing now with on? Yeah, she's fine now. So again, I think it's just a, she just needs to. More time. Okay. But not too much. I just, you know, a few more good sessions and then maybe a reverse shadowing.. We have the onsite next week. Anything you need help on speak about, I don't know. Yeah, so is the Sorry, I'm just reading through the chats here. Yeah. So we're all going to do like an hour kind of session. Is that the deal? Of what we're going to focus on In terms of the area of focus. Yeah. Yeah, like I I mostly want to like care dedicated time to, like, things specifically about these areas and also to see people think the same way about, well, if you get the same idea for three different areas, and also it's a good opportunity for people to give you feedback.m like, hey. Yeah. You are focusing too much on something when there is a bigger problem here, that you're unaw. But I think specifically for you, you have some of the areas are actually, some of your areas are actually not that. Some of it are executing on your own, it's staffing and, like, having these matrics of, like ratio or like creating this, like that, not something that I will put to the Q1 focus for in the area, it might be focused for Steven, the person. But in terms of, like, if we are trying to and they're like, if we are trying to optimize our c and we are trying to create more discipline in clothing chest, you have something going on right now with the queue, I would think if there are other things we should change to make that. Okay. Yeah. Got it. But I keep like I keep and they actually did that exercise a little bit with the whole area because I was trying to think, like, what's. Like, what are I think the way to think about it, so I'm laughing here, but, like, way to think about it is like, look at your audience and thinks like, what are the problems right now there? That although we did some work on the Q Health are still persisting and we think that they will grow when we have more customers and probably not the same growth of people supporting them.. Yeah. And by the way, some of it is, like one of the problems is, like, it's man, like, some of the problems, like, I need to manually go. and like, identify that there is, like, X stickets and thequila, and then I need to like, message these people. So, like, this guy of the idea can't be well, like, you're in Q1, we will move this from manual people, the queue to logic that acts on, you know, on situations. The adult piece of it can be. I don't know. I don't think of it can be, to be honest, is, like.. The way that we're deciding on staffing right now, like, we optimizing Owl by owls, like how many people we need, I don't think so. No. So the bunch of like workbooks we created, in. But like it the best logic? I don't know. We also don't make these changes dynamically, right? And we saw it this week of like, I don't remember who we was, like two people in the se weren't here, and no one went back to thebook and change it. So maybe it's like simplified, like, think about like the stepping and like, not acting on it. That great, I don't know, who we can in Japan or whatever they call it for the butterfly. I think that a lot of, if you think about five minutes about all the problems you have right now is like supply and demand, you're fine a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. Um, it's a good way to look at it. You, I I can't say I'm an optimist. I am an not an optimist. I do have I do enjoy doing a white ball with myself. It's all I is a wine bone in. And I bite myself, what I need to do and then all the things that are not working and then I tacked a of like what is the biggest thing back on that area. So happy to do that exercise with you on case think about it and give you ideas, but like, if I think about what can be done in your area, I go to the hour by hour organization, which I don't think were them. That is that I want you to create about user, which is like this ratio, like us to people. Yeah. First we need to take it for the year. There's probably some work to be done on like a bunch of work, like scenarioos, but right now I don't think it's urgent. I think it's argant to see it with what you have.. Stic what we need. Yeah, and I'm working. That's what I'm working on. I'm excited piece that I'm excited to launch because it's ridiculous that you need to say, people, there are 10 up to like more than 10 minutes and like, people you are not taking more. Like,. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. I shouldn't have to say every time there's ten chats, hey, guys, there's 10 chats. You see managea do like, this is just stupid. I feel stupid. I feel stupid putting it in there, honestly. Yeah, because.. Yeah, I agree with you. But we guess we have to right now, but all of that is what I'm working on changing.. Yep. I think you about to do I have a question for you, and that would be the last question. This very, like, do you, the you healthy on a plug-in pole versa? What was that? The Hue that you, you used to plug in, right? You didn't break it in Sigma, it's the name of the plug in, is that? Oh, uh, that Verselle is where it was deployed. Okay. It was written in it's a react. Okay, that's the language. Yeah. Got it. I guess my question here is like, I was, at some point I was thinking about it. I'm like, and maybe it's a dumb question, but, like, is that something that needs to be a security, like, stop possessor or something? Um.. Yeah. It probably should. Okay. We could, I don't know if we have any place like that where we could host a web app here. I can ask. I can ask for a go. I know that we have a list of and we also put it in our website. I don't know if for this, you will need it? Yeah. or not. But at least, like, it's might be good to just ask the question and not get like a. ask the question now. Yeah. So at least, if we need to change anything down, if least we now. But I would prefer to put it in front of them versus for them to... Yeah. The reason I wasn't so concerned about it is because most of the data is still pulling from Sigma. It's just using the components It's just populating the UI with data that's already in Sigma. However, there is some API calls happening externally from Sigma. But I wasn't that concerned about it. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's essentially just. ID, like numbers and metrics. There's no, like, customer information, you know, customer-sp specific data there. So that's that's kind of why I wasn't immediately concerned with it. But, you know, it probably should, you know, if I stop working here tomorrow, right? You need it needs to live somewhere that's not tied to me. That was just an example. I'll be here tomorrow. for you not to be, so I think we're good. No. But Oh, you mean the fact that it's like it's it's a tied to a person and not to a service again? Yeah, like, exactly. It should be under Sigma account, not under a Stephen account. Is it a Stephen at Sigma account, though? Yeah. Okay. At least it's not. No, no, no. It's my work email, but. I had that too., you know. But still. Okay. Like, the same reason we try not to use our own personal API keys and use a service account that way. Yeah. Yeah. It's probably what should happen. Okay. And I'd be happy to. Let's start with it just having that conversation. Why would Is it even GRC security? GRC? I think.. I'll ask Z, because I think he had to host his web hook somewhere. Okay. And this would be something very similar to that. All. So I might be a good idea just to make sure that I whatever we have there, is okay. Yeah. Once in a while, I get this productive emails about you do this and it's like outside of a policy. So just to make sure that we're coveled. Oh, yeah, that's it. That's a good good thing you do. Yeah. Oh.. Sounds good. Anything else, I can help you win. I did you can check the social stuff. I'll see.. The what policy? I, well, I. Oh, you' I follow it through social stuff, but like, do people actually want on? What down did they do? So great. I'd be interested in doing something. Well. We will do dinner for sure, I also wanted to see if there are people from her team that actually wanted to get, you know, get together with the managers. Seems like they do. Yeah. So it Wednesday. Great. Yep.. Okay. Well, it's easier that it's in the office. Yeah. How is Nikki still out of the office or is he back? Yeah, he's been out all month. He comes back next week. Okay. Yeah. He'll be back. I believe it's next week. Yeah. So, and I still have to figure out his seating when he comes back I just need to reach out to What's her name? HR. Kim. Can't remember her name right now, but because he did request that before he left. Yeah. That's all. I told him I would take care of that. So you can... I'll just be Michelle. Michelle was the.. That's I couldn't think of her name. Okay. Yeah. I'm fine. I don't think we figured that out. Yes, soon than later. Yeah. Sounds good. When do you get in? Well, let me know what? Sorry, when do you get in?. I do my red red, so I'll be there. 8:30 Mondays. Okay. And I'fortunately I leave in Friday, half days, so I' leaving at 12 wine. I'll try to get shop with people besides the on side, so if there is anyone you feel that I need to speak with more than less, let me know. Will deal. Okay. All right. Cool. Well, last but not please, I didn't forget about that and I. I wrote down. I'm going to finish it today, but, like, I need to write down kind of like some.. I don't know if to call it exercise, but like some word that like UN Z can do it together. Yeah. I did some prep to it. I did speak with a couple of people from your team and kind of like not specifically housing and he's doing that I do on talent from you, which is in March, but I did get some like, um things going well, things stuff like can go or like we can like can go a little bit more yeah.
